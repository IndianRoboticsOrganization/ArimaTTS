            The HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) version 2.2
                             release July 7, 2011


The HMM-Based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/) has
been being developed by the HTS working group (see "Who we are" below) and 
others (see "Acknowledgments" below). The training part of HTS has been
implemented as a modified version of the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK)
(http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/).
