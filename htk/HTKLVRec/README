HTKLVRec
--------

This directory is for the HDecode LV recogniser system.

This system is licenced separately from HTK so is not included with
the HTK distribution.  In order to obtain it you must agree to the
licence for HDecode at http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/hdecode_register.shtml
where you will also receive instructions for downloading and building
HDecode.

WINDOWS users: Note after compilation you need to rename HDecode.orig.exe into HDecode.exe and place both HDecode.exe and HDecode.mod.exe into bin.win32 or any other directory storing the rest of HTK executables.
