This directory contains the LaTeX sources of the HTK user
documentation (HTKBook).

Postscript, pdf and html versions of the HTKBook can be downloaded
from 

  http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/docs/docs.shtml

Currently the generation of pdf and html probably only works at CUED,
but we are planning to clean up the LaTeX to make it more portable.
